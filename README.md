# Data Cleaning and Creating Database Project

This project focuses on cleaning and structuring a dataset derived from the Metropolitan Museum of Art's collection. The dataset contains information of over 480,000 artworks in the museum's collection. The goal of this project is to:

1. Clean and preprocess the data, removing any inconsistencies, missing values, and duplicates.
2. Create a structured database that allows for efficient analysis and retrieval of information about the museum's collection, such as names of artworks, artists, artworks' date and more.

The dataset is avaliable at https://github.com/metmuseum/openaccess
